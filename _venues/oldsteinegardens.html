<p>With a daily footfall of one hundred thousand, the Old Steine Gardens are one of the most prominent locations Brighton has to offer. For the period of the festival, the Costume Games&nbsp;Village will feature nightly themed events and parties, supper clubs,&nbsp;costume workshops, secret cinema,&nbsp;and performances. This is where the world's first Cosplay Costume Carnival will be launched on Saturday night to proceed along Brighton's streets to celebrate the opening of the Rugby World Cup.</p>
