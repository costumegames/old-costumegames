<p>On the opening day of The Costume Games, we will be inviting you to join Lady Aiko and other artists to&nbsp;transform&nbsp;the Old Steine Gardens into the Costume Gardens. We want as many people as possible to help&nbsp;create, flashmob style, the most amazing&nbsp;space in Brighton which will become our home over the ensuing five days. To be the first to hear about what we're planning, please leave us your contact details here.</p>
