<p>Never before has something like this been done: to invite&nbsp;some of the <strong>leading names in film costume design</strong> to&nbsp;help people&nbsp;with their costumes&nbsp;before proceeding through the streets of Brighton for the <strong>world's first ever Costume Carnival</strong>. Graham Churchyard, special effects costume designer on the Batman and Harry Potter movies, will be on hand with his friends and colleagues in the run up to the Carnival to turn your costume into something truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>A full line up of costume designers will be announced shortly.</p>
