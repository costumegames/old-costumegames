<p>Never before has something like this been done: to invite&nbsp;some of the <strong>leading names in film costume design</strong> to&nbsp;help people&nbsp;with their costumes&nbsp;before proceeding through the streets of Brighton for the <strong>world's first ever Costume Carnival</strong>. Graham Churchyard, Costume Fx Supervisor on films such as the Chris Nolan Batman trilogy, Captain America, Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers Age of Ultron, will be on hand with prestigious colleagues from the world of costume to help transform you for the big celebration.</p>
<p>A full line up of costume designers will be announced shortly.</p>
