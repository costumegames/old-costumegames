<p>The Costume Games will take place over five days in the prestigious Old Steine Gardens in the heart of Brighton. Because the Costume Games are all about creativity and participation, we will be inviting the citizens of Brighton to help us create the space on the opening day of the festival with world-renowned street artist Lady Aiko.</p>
