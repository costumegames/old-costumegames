<p>From a single day event six years ago, Brighton Japan has expanded exponentially, becoming the largest annual celebration of Japanese culture in Europe.  </p>
<p>In 2013 the festival outgrew its home in Bartholomew Square and took over the prestigious and historically significant site of the Old Steine Gardens in the heart of the city for a full ten days, cementing its reputation as one of the most important fixtures in the city's busy festival calendar.</p>
<p>Located on the main thoroughfare into Brighton and a stone's throw from the Palace Pier and the seafront, the Old Steine Gardens have an estimated footfall of a hundred thousand per day.* </p>
<p>2015 will see the festival become even larger, with the launch of the world's first Cosplay Carnival. The Carnival will be launched from the Old Steine Gardens and progress along Madeira Drive as part of the festivities planned for the opening weekend of the Rugby World Cup.</p>
<p>The Cosplay Carnival is likely to become the centrepiece of future festivals and we look forward to having you on board.</p>
