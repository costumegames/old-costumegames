<p>Ambition. Integrity. Scope. These are what sets Brighton Japan apart, with its ability to feature both the best in international level performances and the very latest in popular street culture. 2015 will see the launch of the world's first COSPLAY CARNIVAL as part of the City's celebrations marking the opening weekend of the Rugby World Cup, which will see Japan playing at the Brighton Community Stadium.</p>
<p>The festival’s relationship with the city’s most important venues, including the prestigious Brighton Dome, Brighton Museum & Art Gallery, Royal Pavilion and the Duke of York’s cinema, means that the festival has the ability to provide a home to the very best businesses, performers, and acts.</p>
